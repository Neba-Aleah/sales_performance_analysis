# Sales Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes regional sales data to identify performance differences across regions.

The objective was to clean raw sales data, aggregate revenue metrics, visualize regional performance, and provide actionable business recommendations based on the findings.

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis — from raw data cleaning to business insight generation.

## 🎯 Objectives
Clean and prepare raw sales data

Identify missing values and handle them appropriately

Analyze total and average revenue by region

Visualize regional performance differences

Provide business recommendations based on data insights.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
The dataset contained inconsistencies such as:

Missing values

Unstandardized column names

Cleaning steps performed:

Standardized column names for consistency

Checked for missing values using isna()

Removed rows with missing values using dropna()

Verified cleaned dataset before analysis.

## 📈 Data Analysis
Using Pandas groupby() functionality:

Calculated total revenue per region

Calculated mean revenue per region

Sorted results to identify top-performing and underperforming regions.

## 📊 Visualization
Bar charts were created to:

Compare total revenue by region

Compare average revenue by region

Visualizations clearly highlighted revenue gaps between regions.

## 💡 Key Insights
The East region generated the highest total revenue.

The South region generated the lowest revenue.

A significant revenue gap exists between top-performing and underperforming regions.

## 🏢 Business Recommendations
Investigate strategies used in the top-performing region and apply similar approaches elsewhere.

Improve marketing and operational efficiency in underperforming regions.

Conduct further analysis to identify additional performance drivers.
